# Personalized Content Recommendation Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm creates a personalized home feed for users based on their interactions, follows, and community activity. It combines multiple signals to surface the most relevant content for each individual user.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The system tracks user interactions including:
- **View tracking**: When users view content
- **Engagement tracking**: Likes, comments, shares
- **Social graph**: Who users follow
- **Community membership**: Which groups users join
- **Interest patterns**: Content themes users engage with most

### 2. Scoring Algorithm
Content receives scores based on multiple factors:

#### **Recency Weight (30%)**
- Recent content (< 1 hour): Score 1.0
- Recent content (< 6 hours): Score 0.8
- Daily content (< 24 hours): Score 0.6
- Older content: Gradual decay over 7 days

#### **Engagement Weight (25%)**
- Each like: +1 point
- Each comment: +2 points (comments are more valuable)
- Each share: +1.5 points
- Normalized to 0-1 scale based on content pool

#### **Similarity Weight (20%)**
- Analyzes content text for keywords/themes
- Matches against user's historical interaction patterns
- Higher scores for content similar to previously liked posts

#### **Social Proof Weight (15%)**
- Content from followed users: High boost (1.0)
- Content from mutual connections: Medium boost (0.6)
- Popular content from strangers: Low boost (0.2)

#### **Diversity Weight (10%)**
- Prevents echo chambers
- Limits repetitive content from same authors
- Introduces variety in content types and topics

### 3. Content Mixing
The final feed combines:
- **70% Microblogs**: Personal posts and discussions
- **30% Communities**: Group recommendations and community content
- Interleaved by final relevance scores

### 4. Personalization Features

#### **Learning from Interactions**
- Every like, comment, view, and share trains the algorithm
- User preferences evolve over time based on activity
- Interest tags automatically generated from interaction patterns

#### **Follow Graph Analysis**
- Content from followed users receives priority
- Discovers trending topics within user's network
- Balances popular content with niche interests

#### **Community-Based Recommendations**
- Suggests communities based on interest overlap
- Promotes content from communities user might enjoy
- Considers member activity and engagement levels

### 5. Real-Time Updates
- Feed refreshes based on new interactions
- Socket.IO integration for live content updates
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Background sync for seamless experience

## Algorithm Evolution

### Current Implementation (Basic Scoring)
- Engagement-based ranking (likes + comments * 2)
- Community popularity scoring (member count / 10)
- Simple content filtering and deduplication

### Advanced Features (Roadmap)
- Machine learning-based content similarity
- Natural language processing for topic extraction
- Collaborative filtering for user similarity
- Time-series analysis for trending content detection
- A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization

## Privacy & Ethics

### Data Usage
- All interaction data stays within the platform
- No external data brokers or third-party tracking
- Users can view and delete their interaction history
- Transparent algorithm explanations available

### Content Diversity
- Actively prevents filter bubbles
- Promotes diverse perspectives within Christian context
- Balances popular and niche content
- Encourages discovery of new communities and topics

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute cache for personalized feeds
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Background processing for heavy computations
- CDN caching for static recommendation data

### Scalability
- Async processing for interaction recording
- Batch processing for recommendation updates
- Horizontal scaling for high-traffic periods
- Efficient memory usage with pagination

## Usage Analytics

### Metrics Tracked
- Click-through rates on recommended content
- Time spent engaging with recommendations
- User satisfaction scores
- Content discovery success rates
- Algorithm performance across user segments

### Feedback Loop
- User interactions continuously improve recommendations
- A/B testing validates algorithm changes
- Performance monitoring ensures quality standards
- Regular algorithm audits for bias detection

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/recommendations/feed` - Personalized content feed
- `POST /api/recommendations/interaction` - Record user interactions
- `GET /api/recommendations/explain` - Algorithm transparency (planned)

### Database Schema
- `user_interactions` - Tracks all user engagement
- `user_follows` - Social graph for recommendations
- `content_scores` - Cached recommendation scores
- `recommendation_logs` - Algorithm performance tracking

### Frontend Integration
- React hooks for seamless data fetching
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Interaction tracking with proper privacy controls
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections

This algorithm creates a personalized experience that helps users discover relevant content while maintaining diversity and preventing echo chambers within the Christian community platform.
