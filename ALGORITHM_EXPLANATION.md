# Faith-Based Personalized Content Recommendation Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm creates a personalized home feed specifically designed for Christian community engagement. It prioritizes faith-based content while balancing relevance, engagement, relationships, and freshness to surface the most meaningful content for each individual user's spiritual journey.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The system tracks user interactions including:
- **View tracking**: When users view content
- **Engagement tracking**: Likes, comments, shares
- **Social graph**: Who users follow
- **Community membership**: Which groups users join
- **Interest patterns**: Content themes users engage with most

### 2. Faith-Based Scoring Algorithm
Content receives scores using the formula: **Score(P, U) = w_e×E + w_r×R + w_t×T + w_f×F**

#### **Engagement Score (40%)**
Faith-based interaction weighting:
- Each like: +1 point
- Each comment: +3 points (comments show deeper engagement)  
- Each share: +5 points (shares spread the Gospel)
- Each save/bookmark: +2 points
- Prayer request interactions: +4 points
- Bible study engagement: +3 points

#### **Relationship Score (30%)**
- Content from followed users: 1.0 (perfect score)
- Content from users with previous interactions: 0.1-0.7
- Unknown users: 0.1 (base score)
- Faith leaders and verified users: Bonus multiplier

#### **Topic Match Score (20%)**
- User interest tag matching: +0.2 per match
- Faith-based keyword detection: +0.1 per keyword (capped at 0.3)
- Faith keywords: bible, scripture, prayer, worship, church, faith, god, jesus, christ, holy spirit, testimony, ministry, gospel, salvation, grace, christian, devotional, sermon, praise
- Content categories: Bible Study, Prayer Requests, Worship, Testimony, Devotional, Apologetics, Ministry, Christian Living

#### **Freshness Score (10%)**
Aggressive boost for fresh spiritual content:
- Content < 1 hour: 1.0 (perfect freshness)
- Content < 6 hours: 0.9 (high freshness) 
- Content < 24 hours: 0.7 (daily content boost)
- Content < 72 hours: 0.4 (recent content)
- Content < 1 week: 0.2 (older content)
- Older content: 0.05 (minimal score)

#### **Trust & Safety Boost**
Additional multiplier for verified content:
- Verified apologetics answerers: +30% boost
- High-engagement authors: +10% boost  
- Positive engagement ratio: +10% boost
- Church/ministry accounts: +20% boost (planned)

### 3. Content Mixing
The final feed combines:
- **70% Microblogs**: Personal posts and discussions
- **30% Communities**: Group recommendations and community content
- Interleaved by final relevance scores

### 4. Personalization Features

#### **Learning from Interactions**
- Every like, comment, view, and share trains the algorithm
- User preferences evolve over time based on activity
- Interest tags automatically generated from interaction patterns

#### **Follow Graph Analysis**
- Content from followed users receives priority
- Discovers trending topics within user's network
- Balances popular content with niche interests

#### **Community-Based Recommendations**
- Suggests communities based on interest overlap
- Promotes content from communities user might enjoy
- Considers member activity and engagement levels

### 5. Real-Time Updates
- Feed refreshes based on new interactions
- Socket.IO integration for live content updates
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Background sync for seamless experience

## Algorithm Evolution

### Current Implementation (Basic Scoring)
- Engagement-based ranking (likes + comments * 2)
- Community popularity scoring (member count / 10)
- Simple content filtering and deduplication

### Advanced Features (Roadmap)
- Machine learning-based content similarity
- Natural language processing for topic extraction
- Collaborative filtering for user similarity
- Time-series analysis for trending content detection
- A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization

## Privacy & Ethics

### Data Usage
- All interaction data stays within the platform
- No external data brokers or third-party tracking
- Users can view and delete their interaction history
- Transparent algorithm explanations available

### Content Diversity
- Actively prevents filter bubbles
- Promotes diverse perspectives within Christian context
- Balances popular and niche content
- Encourages discovery of new communities and topics

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute cache for personalized feeds
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Background processing for heavy computations
- CDN caching for static recommendation data

### Scalability
- Async processing for interaction recording
- Batch processing for recommendation updates
- Horizontal scaling for high-traffic periods
- Efficient memory usage with pagination

## Usage Analytics

### Metrics Tracked
- Click-through rates on recommended content
- Time spent engaging with recommendations
