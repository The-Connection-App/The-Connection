# ðŸ“± MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Strategy: Core Features Only

For rapid deployment and user validation, here's your MVP version focusing on essential features:

### MVP Feature Set (4 Core Screens)
1. **Home Screen** - Welcome and navigation
2. **Communities** - Browse and join groups  
3. **Feed** - Social posts and interactions
4. **Profile** - User authentication and basic settings

### Features to Deploy Later (v2.0)
- Events management
- Prayer requests
- Bible study plans
- Apologetics Q&A
- Advanced profile features

## ðŸš€ MVP Configuration Steps

### 1. Simplified Navigation
Update the tab navigator to show only core features:

**File: `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`**
```typescript
// MVP Version - 4 tabs only
const TabNavigator = () => {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator
      screenOptions={{
        tabBarActiveTintColor: '#E73AA4',
        tabBarInactiveTintColor: '#64748B',
        tabBarStyle: {
          backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
          borderTopColor: '#D1D5DB',
          borderTopWidth: 1,
          paddingBottom: 8,
          paddingTop: 8,
          height: 80,
        },
        headerShown: false,
      }}
    >
      <Tab.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Communities" component={CommunitiesScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Feed" component={MicroblogsScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
};
```

### 2. Simplified Home Screen
Update home to show "Coming Soon" for advanced features:

**File: `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`**
```typescript
const mvpFeatures = [
  {
    title: "Communities",
    description: "Join faith-based communities and connect with believers",
    screenName: "Communities",
    color: "#10B981"
  },
  {
    title: "Feed",
    description: "Share thoughts and engage with community posts",
    screenName: "Feed", 
    color: "#6366F1"
  },
  {
    title: "More Features",
    description: "Prayer requests, events, and Bible study coming soon!",
    onPress: () => Alert.alert("Coming Soon", "More features in the next update!"),
    color: "#64748B"
  }
];
```

### 3. Simplified App Configuration

**File: `app.json`** (Update version and description)
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "The Connection",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Faith-based community platform - MVP version",
    // ... rest of config
  }
}
```

### 4. MVP API Configuration
Keep only essential endpoints active:

**File: `src/services/api.ts`**
```typescript
// MVP endpoints
- /api/user (authentication)
- /api/communities (community list)
- /api/microblogs (social feed)
// Comment out or disable:
// - /api/events
// - /api/prayer-requests
// - /api/bible-study
```
